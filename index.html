          <h2>Polymer</h2>
          <p>
            Google Polymer. A powerful frontend framework utilizing web components to create progressive web apps and build the next generation of websites
            . I've done quite a bit of work using the Polymer 1.0 and 2.0 frameworks. Focusing on material design, the outcomes often are spectacular. A
            couple of my personal projects are soon to be hosted!

          <h2>Cordova</h2>
          <p>
            Apache Cordova. A wrapper for your HTML/CSS/JavaScript which produces a native look and feel application for mobile devices running Android,
            iOS and even Windows. I have used it to wrap various Polymer projects both personal and for work. The material design combined with the native look
            and feel produces a surprisingly brilliant experience.

            I have been doing various free courses through Udacity for a while now and finally decided to through a spanner in the works and opt in for the
            Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree. It it this spanner that has brought this website to life.

          <h2>The Working Life</h2>
          <p>
            I have been working since March 2<sup>nd</sup> 2016 full-time as a developer in one respect or another. Initially I began as a <b>PHP</b> developer
            working on the <b>Totara</b> System, the 'pay-to-play' brother of the Moodle LMS. Working in a team of just 4 developers, we created custom
            functionality for various clients and maintained their LMS. <b>Totara</b> has a fairly unique framework which, while powerful, doesn't really give too
            much experience which can be used elsewhere. For this reason, along with several others, I decided to move on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found myself working at Curve Group virtually immediately as a frontend developer. Thrown into the deep end on day one, I had to rapidly expand
            my knowledge on the <b>Polymer</b> framework and how to wrap it using <b>Cordova</b> to run on <em>Point of Sale</em> devices
