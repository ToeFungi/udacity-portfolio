          <h2>Polymer</h2>
          <p>
            Google Polymer. A powerful frontend framework utilizing web components to create progressive web apps and build the next generation of websites
            . I've done quite a bit of work using the Polymer 1.0 and 2.0 frameworks. Focusing on material design, the outcomes often are spectacular. A
            couple of my personal projects are soon to be hosted!

          <h2>Cordova</h2>
          <p>
            Apache Cordova. A wrapper for your HTML/CSS/JavaScript which produces a native look and feel application for mobile devices running Android,
            iOS and even Windows. I have used it to wrap various Polymer projects both personal and for work. The material design combined with the native look
            and feel produces a surprisingly brilliant experience.

            I have been doing various free courses through Udacity for a while now and finally decided to through a spanner in the works and opt in for the
            Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree. It it this spanner that has brought this website to life.

          <h2>Java</h2>
          <p>
            Spending most of my time in High School developing Java applications for class, I created a few useful apps specifically for personal growth. I
            have experimented with Java networking and game development. First came a Java server hosted on my <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"
            target="_blank"> DigitalOcean</a> server which was powering a simple learning game which kept track of scoring and basic user authentication.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next step was creating a game with multiplayer capabilities. This came in the form of a simple shooter which came with LAN functionality. At
            no point during any of my projects did I use any external libraries. I created my own sound library and created all networking classes myself as
            well. I dislike using external libraries until I fully understand what it is that the code is supposed to do.

          <h2>Totara</h2>
          <p>
            My experience with the Totora LMS came with my first job. I didn't study after school but rather walked straight into the working world. Totara is
            essentially a fork of the Moodle LMS.
