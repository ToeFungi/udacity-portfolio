          <h2>Polymer</h2>
          <p>
            Google Polymer. A powerful frontend tool utilizing web components to create progressive web apps and build the next generation of websites
            . I've done quite a bit of work using the Polymer 1.0 and 2.0 frameworks. Focusing on material design, the outcomes often are spectacular. A
            couple of my personal projects are soon to be hosted!

            Apache Cordova. A wrapper for your HTML/CSS/JavaScript which produces a native look and feel application for mobile devices running Android,
            iOS and even Windows. I have used it to wrap various Polymer projects both personal and for work. The material design combined with the native look
            and feel produces a surprisingly brilliant experience.

            Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree. It it this spanner that has brought this website to life.

          <h2>Java</h2>
          <p>
            Spending most of my time in High School developing Java applications for class, I created a few useful apps specifically for personal growth. I
            have experimented with Java networking and game development. First came a Java server hosted on my <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/"
            target="_blank"> DigitalOcean</a> server which was powering a simple learning game which kept track of scoring and basic user authentication.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next step was creating a game with multiplayer capabilities. This came in the form of a simple shooter which came with LAN functionality. At
            no point during any of my projects did I use any external libraries. I created my own sound library and created all networking classes myself as
            well. I dislike using external libraries until I fully understand what it is that the code is supposed to do.

          <h2>Totara</h2>
          <p>
            My experience with the Totora LMS came with my first job. I didn't study after school but rather walked straight into the working world. Totara is
            essentially a fork of the Moodle LMS. While Moodle became free to use, Totara went down an alternate route and became proprietary software. I was
            one of 4 developers working on supporting client's invocations while also creating and maintaining custom functionality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Totara was a rather unique PHP framework and worked with an MVC pattern. It was my first experience with PHP and frameworks and since then I have
            used many different PHP frameworks for personal projects to further my understanding of the language.

          <h2>Polymer</h2>
          <p>
            A lot of my newer personal projects use Polymer to build the frontend in part owing to the beauty that is material design. In addition Polymer
            utilizes the power of web components which is the future of the web. I create some of my own web components to maximize reusability for future
            personal projects and use predominantly Polymer web components to ensure quality as well as ensuring that the component will be maintained by
            professional developers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Polymer is also used for the projects that I port to Android. It is powerful enough to maintain it's responsiveness while also not causing any
            type of lag or delay in frontend responses.

          <h2>Apache Cordova</h2>
          <p>
            Almost all of my personal projects involving Polymer have ended up being wrapped with Cordova to create an Android port. Some of my applications
            have been developed purely for mobile with no intention of hosting it in the near future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although there are some limitations of Cordova, most can be overcome with the help of plugins. I have attempted to create a couple of plugins in
            for work related plugins but have since found better replacements. I have not yet had a need to develop any plugin for personal projects but I
            there will come a time where it will become a necessity to develop my own plugins.

          <h2>Lumen</h2>
          <p>
            Referred to by some as Laravel's baby brother, it is used primarily to develop RESTful PHP API's. A couple of my projects have either included
            APIs or have actually been to develop an API. The most complete API that I currently have hosted is a <em>Number Plates</em> API for South
            African number plates. The documentation (incomplete as of 05/10/2017) can be found <a href="https://docs.thetoefungi.co.za/number-plates"
            target="_blank">here</a>. The API currently can check location of a specific number plate prefix/suffix as well as validate number plates to
            ensure that it conforms to the specific patterns of South African number plates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another API that I have been working on is more of a wrap for an existing 3<sup>rd</sup> party API, namely DuoLingo. The existing API wasn't
            designed perfectly in my opinion and the pertinent information was difficult to find. This gave me a reason to create a wrap for it so that I can
            then use my API in personal projects for monitoring progress on DuoLingo.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a work capacity, I have been developing with Lumen for about a year. Building various middleware components for various projects.
